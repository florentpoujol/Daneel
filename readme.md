## Repo structure

The main `.lua` files are in the `framework` folder.  
The scripts at the root of the folder are 'global' and don't need to be added as scripted behavior on game objects (contrary to the one found in the `scripted behaviors` folder).

The `daneelcomplete/DaneelComplete.lua` script (and its minified version) is an aggregation of all the 'global' scripts at the root of the `framework` folder.
